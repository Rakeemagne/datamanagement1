/*Preamble
For this problem set, I finalized the data that I will use for my final 
project by organizing it so to provide by graphs of interest to understanding 
whether or not research questions are answered by the data. I started to gain a
better picture of the impact of Black teachers in charter schools within NJ. I 
initally looked to make my focus all school districts in NJ (674). But the large 
sample complicated my ability to complete the tasks laid out in previous 
problem sets. I could have minimized my number of schools by focusing on one 
county in particular, but rather I chose to focus on charter schools because 
charter schools (89) provides me with a small enough number as to not complicate
organizing the data while at the same time providing me with the maximum sample 
size for that category of schools. In addition to providing graphs, I also run
a regression or two to understand exactly what the data tells us about our 
research questions
*/

/*Research Goal
This research is to explore the impact Black teachers have in charter schools 
in two key areas: Black student discipline and Black student academic 
achievement as per student test scores.
*/

/*Research Questions
1. Does a charter school and/or district suspend fewer black students when 
there are more Black teachers employed in that charter school and/or district?
2. Does a charter school and/or district produce higher test scores for Black 
students when there are more Black teachers employed in that charter school and/
or district?
*/

/*Hypothesis
1. Charter schools and/or districts do suspend fewer black students when 
there are more Black teachers employed in that charter school and/or district 
2. Charter schools and/or districts produce higher test scores for Black 
students when there are more Black teachers employed in that charter school and/
or district?

/*Data Description
Data for this study comes from various sources. The first source (1) is school 
performance data from the NJ state department of education. This is data that
provides provide families, educators and the public valuable information about 
how a school is doing across several sections: academic progress, college and
career readiness, etc. The Summary Reports compare school performance to overall
state performance and state targets. The second source (2) is the certificated 
staff data from the NJ state department of education. This data provides 
Information on the totals and percentages of teachers and administrators 
according to race and ethnicity. The third source (3) is student suspension data 
from the U.S. Department of Education Civil Rights Data Collection. This data
provides a variety of information including student enrollment and educational 
programs and services, most of which is disaggregated by race/ethnicity, sex, 
limited English proficiency, and disability. The fourth source (4) is Local 
Education Agency (School District) Universe Survey Data from the National 
Center for Education Statistics. This data provides basic information about all 
education agencies and the students for whose education the agencies are 
responsible. The fifth and final source (5) is municipal tax rates from the NJ 
Fact Book. This data source is published as a free public service by Rutgers' 
Center for Government Services that includes statistics on New Jerseyâ€™s 565 
municipalities, its legislative districts, counties, schools, elections, and 
people.

discipline data, we need to control for other variables to really see if the 
relationships hold up. We can answer this question through a series of regression 
tests. We first start with a look at discipline. We'll control for the following 
variables: the percent of (1) Black students, (2) Latinx students, (3) disabled 
students, (4) economically disadvantaged students, (5) student chronically absent 
(6) certified teachers, (7) first year teachers, and (8) teachers absent 10 days
